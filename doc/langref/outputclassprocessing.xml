         <p>During transformation from XML to HTML, the value
of outputclass is output instead of the class name ordinarily generated for
the element.  This new class can then be used by a CSS stylesheet to apply
alternate formatting rules to the output HTML document.</p>
         <p> For example,
if a paragraph element is normally rendered in regular font but a bold paragraph
is required, you could put boldpara as a value for the outputclass attribute,
and then write a CSS stylesheet that applies bold formatting to result elements
that will have that class value (for example, <codeph>.boldpara {font-weight:
bold; display: block;}</codeph>). The paragraph is then displayed as bold
when you view the HTML output using your CSS in a web browser. </p>
