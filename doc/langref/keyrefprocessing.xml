   <title>keyref processing</title>
   <refbody>
      <section>
         <title>Design note:</title> The intent of keyref is to provide indirection
to linking information as an alternative to using href for hardcoded paths
directly in your content. When you use keyref, you allow different processes
to form the linking relationship in different ways: for example, a reviewing
process might look up internal address and phone number information for the
author, while a publishing process might look up a company address and feedback
email address.<p>This functionality is not yet supported in DITA processing.</p>
