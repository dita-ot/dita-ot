  <title>Building DITA output with Ant</title>
  <shortdesc>Ant is an open tool that uses the DITA processes to make producing 
    DITA output easier.</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction of Ant </b>
    </p>
    <p>DITA provides a set of XSLT scripts for producing different types of 
      documentations such as: help output in Eclipse, Java Help and HTML Help, 
      web HTML pages and PDF file. </p>
    <p>To make it easier to call these scripts, the DITA distribution now 
      provides an experimental Ant tool to automatically build the DITA 
      documentations, demos, and samples. </p>
    <p>Ant is a Java-based, open source tool provided by the Apache Foundation 
      to declare a sequence of build actions. Meanwhile, Ant is well suited for 
      development builds as well as document builds. </p>
    <p>It is unnecessary for Ant to set up a build environment to run the DITA 
      XSLT scripts. To run the DITA scripts directly, see the <xref 
      href="DITA-readme.xml#DITA-readme">DITA Readme</xref> 
      document.</p>
    <note>The following instructions and the associated <i>build.xml</i> and 
      <i>ditatargets.xml </i> files are for the Java 1.4.2, Ant 1.6.2, FOP 
      0.20.5, and Saxon 6.5.3 releases. These instructions are likely to need 
      some adjustment for other versions of these components and for specific 
      environments.</note>
