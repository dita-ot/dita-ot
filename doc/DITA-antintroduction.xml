  <shortdesc>You can use the Ant build tool to automate builds that use the 
    DITA processes including output for the sample documents provided with 
    DITA. </shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>DITA provides a set of XSLT scripts for producing help output in 
      Eclipse, Java Help and HTML Help, for producing web HTML pages, or for 
      producing PDF. To make it easier to invoke these scripts, the DITA 
      distribution now provides an experimental Ant file that you can use to 
      build the DITA documentation, demos, and samples. </p>
    <p>Ant is a Java-based, Open Source tool provided by the Apache Foundation 
      to declare a sequence of build actions. As such, Ant is well suited for 
      document builds as well as development builds. </p>
    <p>You do not have to set up a build environment, of course to run the DITA 
      XSLT scripts. To execute the DITA scripts directly, see the <xref>DITA 
      Readme</xref> document.</p>
    <note>The following instructions and the associated <i>build.xml</i> and 
      <i>ditatargets.xml</i> files are for the Java 1.4.2, Ant 1.6.5, FOP 
      0.20.5, and Saxon 6.5.3 releases. These instructions are likely to need 
      some adjustment for other versions of these components and for specific 
      environments.</note>
