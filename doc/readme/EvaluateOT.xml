<title>Evaluating the DITA Open Toolkit (Full Easy Install)</title>
<abstract><shortdesc>The most common scenario for first users of the DITA Open
Toolkit is to evaluate how it functions.</shortdesc> Previous versions of the
Toolkit required a number of preliminary installation steps for components
necessary both to run the base function and to show off additional
output capabilities. For each release since DITA-OT 1.4.2, three versions
of the Toolkit are available: the minimal package (contains core function
only), standard package (minimal plus docs and demos), and a &quot;full
easy install package&quot; that basically installs everything you
need to enable quick and easy evaluation of the Toolkit. This topic
deals with installing and using the full easy install package for
the first time.</abstract>
<conbody>
<note>This topic explains how to use the Full Easy Install on Windows;
the three versions are also available on all other supported platforms.
For a description of all packages available, see <xref format="html"
href="http://dita.xml.org/wiki/dita-ot-packages" scope="external">What
packages are available for the DITA Open Toolkit</xref> at dita.xml.org.</note>
<p>Unzip or extract the &quot;full_easy_install&quot; zip file to a convenient directory, such as
      your c: drive&apos;s root directory. The package will create a directory such as
        <filepath>C:\DITA-OT<keyword keyref="release.version"/>\</filepath> that contains not only the usual Toolkit
      materials but also all the run-time components needed to run the Toolkit in a basic evaluation
      mode.</p>
<p>Browse over to this new directory and double-click on the &quot;startcmd.bat&quot;
file in that directory. A new &quot;command shell&quot; window will
open up, with the environment variables already set to enable the
Toolkit to run within that shell.</p>
  <p>At the command prompt (usually <filepath>C:\DITA-OT<keyword keyref="release.version"
        />\</filepath> for this version), type &quot;ant samples.web -f build_demo.xml&quot;. After
      a series of processing messages, there should be a new out\ directory in the
          <filepath>DITA-OT<keyword keyref="release.version"/>\</filepath> directory that contains a
      folder with the resulting HTML output in it. Congratulations on creating your first example of
      DITA output!</p>
<p>Now try the full set of transforms from a single command: &quot;ant
all -f build_demo.xml&quot;. This command will process DITA samples
in the toolkit into many of the supported output types for the Toolkit.
After a much longer flurry of messages, the out\ directory should
have a number of folders in it, each with several deliverables produced
by the Toolkit demos. If you happen to have the Microsoft HTMLHelp
Workshop or the JavaHelp toolset installed for other work you have
done with User Assistance, you might even get ready-to use CHM and
JavaHelp output files. By comparing the outputs with the various source
materials in the distribution, you can get an idea about how the processing
works. That explanation is best found in the DITA Open Toolkit User
Guide and at the <xref format="HTML"

<section><title>Demo targets</title><p>Here are the individual demo
targets that you can try while evaluating the DITA Open Toolkit. Note
that most are subcomponents of larger operations--you can use any
of these individually. Earlier releases also contained demo targets
for building the DITA 1.1 Language Specification, but that was removed
in DITA-OT 1.5.2 because it was superseded by the DITA 1.2 specification.</p><pre>

you do not specify a target for <filepath>build_demo.xml</filepath>,
the default target is <codeph>prompt</codeph>. </p><p>You can also
try your hand at modifying some of the sample scripts in the ant directory.
These represent the kind of driver files that you would create for
your own projects. You can easily adapt these to process your own
test DITA files, for example. Call the other ant samples after this
example: </p><pre>C:\DITA-OT-<keyword keyref="release.version"/>>ant -f samples/ant_sample/sample_xhtml.xml</pre><?Pub
Caret 15?><p>(This is basically the same as running <codeph>ant samples.web
-f build_demo.xml</codeph>, but intended for you to modify.) </p><p>You
will find the output for this exercise in the <filepath>samples/ant_sample/</filepath> directory
itself. You can add parameters to the <filepath>sample_xhtml.xml</filepath> file
to change where your outputs end up, and also to modify the build
process in other ways. See the documentation for Ant parameters to
learn more about processing options.</p></section>
