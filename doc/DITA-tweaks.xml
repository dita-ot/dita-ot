<title>Controls, parameters, tweaks, and gizmos for <i>dita2htmlImpl.xsl</i></title>
<shortdesc>If the available methods can not fully match your own output requirements,
DITA Toolkit supports other ways to customize or enhance the transforms without
having to modify core transforms directly.</shortdesc>
<refbody>
  <section>
    <p>The <i>dita2htmlImpl.xsl</i> file is the main XHTML processor to produce 
      the output. You can work with the following variables and parameters to 
      change the way of processing.</p>
    <p>If you need to make code changes to <i>dita2htmlImpl.xsl</i> to change a 
      variable value, the preferred mechanism is to create an override 
      transform and place your changed code in the new transform. </p>
    <p>Here is an example of an override transform: <ol> <li>In the 
      <tt>/xsl/</tt> directory, make a copy of the <i>dita2xhtml.xsl</i> file 
      and change the filename of the copy.</li> <li>Add your XSLT changes 
      within the new file.</li> </ol> </p>
    <note type="note">
      <ul>
        <li>Making editing changes to XSLT transforms is not included in this 
          document; refer to another XSLT reference for guidance.</li>
        <li>It is not recommended to edit any of the DITA distribution files, 
          because your modification might be erased by package updates.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for any change you make to DITA transforms. If 
          you need help, the <xref format="html" 
          href="news://news.software.ibm.com/ibm.software.developerworks.xml.xml">DITA 
          forum on developerWorks</xref> may be a useful resource.</li>
