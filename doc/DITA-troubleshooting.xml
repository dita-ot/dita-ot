      <title>1. Out of Memory Error</title>
      <p>In some cases, you might receive a message stating the build has 
        failed due to an "Out of Memory" error. Please follow the steps below 
        to fix this problem:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p>For Windows, type <codeph>set ANT_OPTS=%ANT_OPTS% -Xmx256M</codeph> 
            in the command prompt, you can also choose to add a new opition 
            <codeph>-Xmx256M</codeph> to the <codeph>ANT_OPTS</codeph> 
            environment variable.</p>
            <p>For Linux, type <codeph>export ANT_OPTS=${ANT_OPTS} -Xmx256M</codeph> 
            in the command prompt.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Run the transformation again.</li>
      </ol>

        <title>2. java.io.IOException: Can't store Document</title>
        <p>In some cases, when you run the JavaHelp transformation, you might 
          receive the exception above. This problem is caused by some HTML 
          files unrelated with the current JavaHelp transformation were found 
          under the output directory. Please follow the steps below to fix 
          this problem:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Change into the output directory.</li>
          <li>Clean the output directory.</li>
          <li>Run the JavaHelp transformation again.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>3. Failed to load message file</title>
        <p>In some situations, the toolkit may fails to load the message file 
          due to some exceptions thrown.</p>
        <p>To fix this problem, you need to check if there are files 
          'resource/messages.xml' and 'resource/messages.dtd' in the directory 
          that you run the toolkit. If not, please copy them from the toolkit's 
          root directory.</p>

    <section>
      <title>4. Spaces in file names</title>
      <p>Spaces in file names will cause trouble during the processing because Ant
      use space as the delimiter when processing batch files in a list. Please 
      prevent using spaces in the name of dita files.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>5. Stack Overflow</title>
      <p>Sometimes, you will receive an error during the transformation which says
      the stack memory overflows. Please follow the steps below to fix the problem:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p>For Windows, type <codeph>set ANT_OPTS=%ANT_OPTS% -Xms512M</codeph> 
          in the command prompt, you can also choose to add a new opition 
          <codeph>-Xms512M</codeph> to the <codeph>ANT_OPTS</codeph> 
          environment variable.</p>
          <p>For Linux, type <codeph>export ANT_OPTS=${ANT_OPTS} -Xms512M</codeph> 
            in the command prompt.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Run the transformation again.</li>
      </ol>
