    <section>
      <title>DITA OT release 1.1.2.1</title>
      <p>Release 1.1.2.1 is a full build to provide an urgent fix to fix the following critical problem which users found in release 1.1.2.</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>SF Bug 1345600  The build process failed when run "Ant all" in release 1.1.2</li>
        </ul>             
      </p>
      <p>For this fix, we have restored all the source DITA files in 'doc' and directories in the binary packages.</p>
      <p>Note that the original parameter "args.eclipse.toc" in "Ant tasks and script" was separated to "args.eclipsehelp.toc" for DITA-to-Eclipse help transformation, and "args.eclipsecontent.toc" for DITA-to-dynamic Eclipse content transformation.</p>
      <p>Another issue is that we found there is a mismatch in the document and the toolkit behavior when you are trying to use the following command
      <codeblock>ant -f conductor.xml -propertyfile ${dita.temp.dir}/property.temp.</codeblock>
      Now we have updated the documentation. Please refer to the topic 'Building DITA output with Java command line' on our website for more details.</p>
      <p>These updates do not affect standard operation of the toolkit. The main goal of this minor release to enable new users of the toolkit to run the installation verification tests without failure.</p>

      <title>DITA OT release 1.1.2</title>
      <p>Release 1.1.2 is a maintenance release to fix defects and make patches based on release 1.1.1. </p>
      <p>But there are certain limitations and unfixed bugs in this release, such as,
        <ul>
          <li>Bug 1343963 Blank index.html generated for ditamap contains only reltabe</li>
          <li>Bug 1344486 java.io.EOFException thrown out when reading ditaval file</li>
        </ul>       
        Please check the current 'open' bugs on the SourceForge bugs tracker.

      <title>DITA OT release 1.1</title>
      <p>Release 1.1 is a major release to add new functions, fulfill new requirements, make some function enhancements and fix bugs over release 1.0.2.</p>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Adaptation to the new OASIS DITA standard</b>
            <p>Release 1.1 implements the new OASIS DITA 1.0 standard for DITA DTDs and Schemas.</p>
            <p>DTDs of the previous release locate in the directory <b>dtd/dita132</b> and schemas of the previous release locate in the directory <b>schema/dita132</b>. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Transformation to troff</b>
            <p>Release 1.1 supports new troff output. Troff output looks like Linux man page output.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>XML catalog support</b>
            <p>An XML catalog, which can consist of several catalog entry files, is a logical structure that describes mapping information between public IDs and URLs of DTD files. A catalog entry file is an XML file that includes a group of catalog entries. If you want to know more about XML catalog, please refer<xref href="xmlcatalog.xml">XML Catalog</xref>.</p>
            <p>A catalog entry can be used to locate a unified resource identifier (URI) reference for a certain resource such as a DTD file. An external entity&apos;s public identifier is used for mapping to the URI reference. The URI of any system identifier can be ignored.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Topicref referring to a nested topic</b>
            <p>The href attribute of the topicref is extended to quote a nested topic in a dita file.</p>
            <p>For example, in previous releases, href attribute is set like: href = &quot;xxx.dita&quot;; in release 1.1, href attribute can be set like: href = &quot;xxx.dita#abc.dita&quot;.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Globalization support</b>
            <p>Release 1.1 supports over 20 popular languages within the content of dita files. And it also provides translation function for DITA keywords to over 20 languages. Currently this globalization support fully applies to Eclipse Help and XHTML transformations, and partially applies to other transformations.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Accessibility support</b>
            <p>Accessibility support is now partially applies to PDF and XHTML transformations.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Eclipse Content Provider Support</b>
            <p>Please refer to <xref href="eclipseconprov.xml">Eclipse Content Provider</xref> for detail information.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Index information in output</b>
            <p>The output of HTML Help and Java Help transformations contain index information now.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Mapref function</b>
            <p>Mapref refers to a special usage of the <tt>&lt;topicref&gt;</tt> element as a reference to another ditamap file. This allows you to manage the overall ditamap file more easily. A large ditamap file can thus be broken down into several ditamap files, making it easier for the user to manage the overall logical structure. On the other hand, this mechanism also increases the reusability of those ditamap files. If you want to know more about mapref, please refer <xref href="mapref.xml">Mapref</xref>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>TOC generation for Eclipse Help transformation</b>
            <p>TOC generation now supported in transformation to Eclipse Help. Eclipse.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Helpset generation for Java Help transformation</b>
            <p>Helpset generation now supported in transformation to Java Help.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>New parameters supported in Java commands</b>
            <p>In Java commands: /indexshow, /outext, /copycss, /xsl, /tempdir.</p>

    <section>
      <title>DITA OT release 1.0</title>
      <p>The initial release of the Open Sourced DITA Toolkit introduces major 
        architectural changes from the previous, developerWorks version of the 
        Toolkit. </p>
      <p>
        <b>New features</b>
        <ol>
          <li>A new, Java-based processing architecture that supports 
            single-threaded execution throughout.</li>
          <li>Ant-based orchestration of the processing environment, from 
            preprocessing to transformation to any required 
            post-processing.</li>
          <li>A pre-processor core that supports conditional processing and 
            conref resolution.</li>
          <li>Map-driven processing that generates links for transformed 
            topics.</li>
          <li>A new DITA to HTML transform that replaces the previous 
            topic2html_Impl.xsl core transform. This new core is based on 
            requirements for high-volume usage within IBM for the past several 
            years.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>Ant-driven processing means that you can integrate the DITA processing 
        tools into a seamless pipeline within supportive environments such as 
        Eclipse.</p>
      <p>The DTDs and Schemas in this version are based on those in the 
        previous dita132 package with bug fixes. The DITA OS Toolkit will later 
        support the OASIS 1.0 specification in its public review form.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>DITA history on developerWorks (pre-Open Source)</title>
      <p>Versions of the toolkit prior to Open Source are in the developerWorks 
        XML Zone at this address: <xref format="html" 
        href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-dita6/x-dita_downloads.html">DITA 
        Downloads</xref> Change logs for those versions are within the Readme 
        files in each distribution.</p>
