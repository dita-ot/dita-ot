        exactly as entered. However, there are also types of information that are usually authored
        in context with a thought or issue, but upon output, the content might be relocated,
        suppressed, or used only for purposes such as inline annotations for drafts. These elements
        include footnotes, index entries, draft comments, and special cleanup containers that can
        hold migrated data that still needs a writer's intervention to get into the right
