      <p class="- topic/p ">DITA topics support two types of tables. One is the most common table
        format used in industry, the &lt;<apiname class="+ topic/keyword pr-d/apiname ">CALS
          table</apiname>&gt; (or more recently known also as the Oasis Table Exchange Model). The
        CALS table supports the spanning of multiple rows or columns for special layout or
        organizational needs, and provides a wide variety of controls over the display properties of
        the data and even the table structure itself.<indexterm class="- topic/indexterm ">Table
          elements</indexterm>
      </p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">The other table structure in DITA is called &lt;<apiname
          class="+ topic/keyword pr-d/apiname ">simpletable</apiname>&gt;. As the name implies, it
        is structurally less sophisticated than the CALS table, and can be used as a very simple,
        regular table for which close control of formatting is not as important. However, the main
        advantage of simpletable is for describing lists of data with regular headings, such as
        telephone directory listings, display adapter configuration data, or API properties. </p>
