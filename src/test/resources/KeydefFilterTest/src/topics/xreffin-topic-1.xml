  <title>XReffing Topic 1</title>
  <body>
    <p>This topic has an xref to the key "target_topic_1": <xref
        keyref="target_topic_1"/>. It should resolve to topic A in the context of Root Map 01 and
      topic B in the context of Root Map 02.</p>
    <p>This is an xref to the key "target_topic_2": <xref
        keyref="target_topic_2"/>. It should resolve to topic C in both maps.</p>
    <p>This is an xref to the undefined key "target_topic_3": <xref
        keyref="target_topic_3"/>. It should result in an "undefined key" message from the processor
      and result in an empty xref.</p>
    <p>This is an xref to the undefined key "target_topic_3" where the xref also specifies an href=
      value, which should be used as the fallback. The link should be to topic C: <xref
        keyref="target_topic_3"
        href="target-topic-c.xml"/>.</p>
