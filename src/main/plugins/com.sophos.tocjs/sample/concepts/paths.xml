 <title>Resolving path issues</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>The sample documents and related ant tasks work for a relatively simple directory structure.
   They
   assume that your content and output directory structure will be something like:
   <screen>
    sample/
    |-- basefiles
    |-- concepts
    `-- tasks   
   </screen>However, if your ditamap refers to content in other parallel project directories, your output
   will have a deeper path to the same files. For instance, imagine your ditamap file is in the root of
   the <filepath>sample</filepath> directory, but it includes a reference to a topic in
   <filepath>other</filepath> such as:
   <codeblock>
&lt;topicref href=&quot;concepts/foo.xml&quot;&gt;
 &lt;topicref href=&quot;concepts/bar.xml&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;topicref href=&quot;../other/concepts/baz.xml&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/topicref&gt;    
   </codeblock>
   Referencing content in this way will force a deeper nesting to the output directory. The
   directory structure of your content in the output directory would now be:
   <screen>
    sample/
    |-- other
    |   `-- concepts
    `-- sample
        |-- concepts
        `-- tasks
   </screen>
  Note that there are now two <filepath>sample</filepath> directories in the output, the main one and one that is a
   sibling to the <filepath>other</filepath> directory. The files are generated by the
   Open Toolkit for the sample project now wind up in the deeper nested <filepath>sample</filepath>
   directory.</p>
