 <title>The <filepath>basefiles</filepath> directories</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>When you set up a project to build tocjs output, you will likely want to pull source files from
   two separate locations. The tocjs plugin has a <filepath>basefiles</filepath> directory that
   includes HTML, JavaScript, image and CSS files necessary for the tocjs plugin to work. The tocjs
   transtype itself generates a JavaScript file (<filepath>toctree.js</filepath>) that is used in
   conjunction with the files in this <filepath>basefiles</filepath> directory. As you can see in
   the sample ant tasks in <filepath>demo/tocjs/buildsample.xml</filepath>.</p>
  <p>You will likely want to maintain another <filepath>basefiles</filepath> directory along with
   your DITA source files and copy these into your output as well. If you look in the
   tocjs <filepath>sample</filepath> project there is a different <filepath>basefiles</filepath>
   directory. This contains the CSS file related to the DITA content and the
   <filepath>frameset.html</filepath> file. These are specific to the project, while the files in
   <filepath>demo/tocjs/basefiles</filepath> are for any project using the tocjs plugin.</p>
