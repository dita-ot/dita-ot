<P>____________________________________</P>
<P>This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31 
2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license 
can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that 
ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated 
version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". Otherwise, 
this version is the same as the <A 
href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software-19980720">previous 
version</A> and is written so as to preserve the <A 
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses">Free 
Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility</A> and <A 
href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/W3C.php">OSI's certification</A> under 
the <A href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php">Open Source 
Definition</A>. Please see our <A
