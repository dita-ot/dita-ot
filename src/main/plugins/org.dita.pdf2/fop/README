What is FOP?
------------

Apache FOP is a print formatter driven by XSL formatting objects. It is a Java
application that reads a formatting object tree conforming to the XSL 1.1
Recommendation (05 December 2006) and then turns it into a PDF document,
certain other output formats or allows you to preview it directly on screen.
Note that not all parts of the XSL 1.1 specification have yet been
implemented.

Apache FOP is part of Apache's XML Graphics project. The homepage of Apache 
FOP is http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/.

details.

Major Changes in Version 0.93

* Added support for the use of Open Type fonts (BD)

  text using embedded TrueType fonts. (BD) Thanks to Adam Strzelecki,
  Victor Mote. Fixes 5535.

  be a bit incomplete. Feedback is welcome!)
* The Java2DRenderer (and therefore the print and bitmap renderers) is
  now offering the same quality as the PDF and PS renderers. Note:
  There can still be little differences between PDF and Print/PNG/TIFF
  because the latter uses a different font metrics source.
* Automatic support for all fonts available to the Java2D subsystem
  for all Java2D-descendant renderers (TIFF, PNG, print, AWT).
