## Used for <section> and <example>. This can nest any of the following elements.
section = element section {
  debug,
  sectiontitle?,
  (block | \text)*
}

## Used for the titles of <section> and <example>. This will nest the <text> element.
sectiontitle = element sectiontitle {
  debug,
  \text+
}

## All other block-like elements. The reason section does not use <block> 
## is that it maps well to troff-style sections that use the .SH macro
## for highlighting and indenting. This can nest any number of <block> 
## or <text> elements. Attributes set lead-in text (such as list item numbers 
## that must appear before the list item text), as well as indent values.
## Other attributes are described below.
block = element block {
  debug?,
  style,
  attribute xml:space { "preserve" | "default" }?,
  attribute leadin {text}?,
  attribute indent { xsd:int }?,
  attribute position {text}?,
  attribute compact { "yes" | "no" }?,
  (section | block | \text)+
}

## All text nodes and phrases. This can include text or additional <text> elements.
## Text will be wrapped, with the width determined by the LINELENGTH parameter. 
## Formatters such as troff may reflow the text as needed. Line breaks should only
## be forced in pre-formatted text, or between blocks.
