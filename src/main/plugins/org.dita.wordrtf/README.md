## RTF Resources

### RTF Specification
- The most current versions of the RTF specification (1.8 and 1.9.1) are available from [Microsoft](http://search.microsoft.com/en-us/DownloadResults.aspx?q=rtf+specification&sortby=-availabledate)
- Older versions (1.3, 1.5, 1.7) can be found on the [RTF Tools website](http://www.snake.net/software/RTF/).

### Sean M. Burke
The definitive authority regarding RTF is Sean M. Burke. 
- The best reference is his ["RTF Pocket Guide"](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596004750.do) from O'Reilly.  
- Basic information on RTF is also available from his [RTF Cookbook - RTF overview and quick reference](http://search.cpan.org/~sburke/RTF-Writer/lib/RTF/Cookbook.pod) (part of the RTF-Writer Perl module).
- There's additional information on his website http://interglacial.com/rtf/.
