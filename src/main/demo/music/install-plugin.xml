     This is a shortcut file that will integrate the plugin, if you do not regularly
     run the integrator as part of a build. This does not actually need to change for
     any new plugin, but it is a good idea to update the name attribute on <plugin>.

     Alternatively, from the main toolkit directory, you could integrate with:
     ant -f integrator.xml
