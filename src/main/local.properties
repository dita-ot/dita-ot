# Read these properties by <import file="${wherever}/local.properties.xml"/>
# local.properties.xml, which is located in the same directory as local.properties, can
# determine the directory in which both files reside. This allows the local properties
# to be read from both the distribution build and the ant targets that are executed from
# within the distributed OT.
#
# local.properties.xml will set the property local.basedir to the directory containing
# both local.properties.xml and local.properties.
