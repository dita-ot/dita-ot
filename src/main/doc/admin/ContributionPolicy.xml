<section>       <title>DUE DILIGENCE AND RECORD KEEPING</title>  
    <p>The Committer(s), shall be responsible for scrutinizing all
Content          contributed to the DITA Open Toolkit project and
help ensure that the          Contribution Policy licensing requirements
set forth above are met.          Except as set forth below, the applicable
Committer shall conduct the          following activities prior to
uploading any Content into the repository          or otherwise making
the Content available for distribution: </p>       <ol>
<li>Contact the potential contributor of the Content through an  
         appropriate channel of communication and collect/confirm
the            following:           <ul>
<li>Contributor&apos;s name, current address, phone            number
and e-mail address;</li>
<li>Name and contact information of            the contributor&apos;s
current employer, if any;</li>
<li>If the            contributor is not self-employed, the Committer
must request and            receive a signed <xref
href="ContributionForm.xml">consent form</xref> (to be provided by
the Committer) from            the contributor&apos;s employer confirming
that the employer does not            object to the employee contributing
the Content. </li>
<li>Determine            if the Content can be contributed under the
terms of the CPL and           Apache License 2.0 or the         
  alternative terms and conditions supplied by the Contributor. This
           can be done by asking the contributor questions such as; <ol>
<li>Did            you develop all of the Content from scratch;</li>
<li>If not, what            materials did you use to develop the Content?</li>
<li>Did you            reference any confidential information of any
third party? </li>
<li>If you referenced third party materials, under what terms did
you            receive such materials? </li>
</ol></li>
<li>If it is determined by            the Committer that the Content
is not the original work of the            Contributor, collect the
contact information of the copyright holder            of the original
or underlying work. The copyright holder of the            Content
or the underlying work may then need to be contacted to          
 collect additional information.</li>
</ul>         </li>
<li>The <draft-comment>was            &quot;Committer(s)&quot;</draft-comment>Contributor(s)
shall document            all information requested in (1) above and
fill in Contribution            Questionnaire (to be provided by the
Committer) and provide the            completed Contribution Questionnaire
to the Committer.</li>
<li>The Committer shall also be responsible for running a scan tool
to            help ensure that the Content does not include any code
not identified            by the contributor.</li>
<li> Based on the information collected, the Committer shall use 
          his/her reasonable judgment to determine if the Content
can be            contributed under terms and conditions that are
consistent with the            licensing requirements of this IP Policy. </li>
</ol>       <p>If the applicable Committer has any doubts about the
ability to          distribute the Content under terms and conditions
that are consistent          with the CPL and Apache License 2.0 or
the proposed alternative terms and conditions, the          Committer
may not upload the code to the repository or otherwise          distribute
the Content. The Committer(s) shall be responsible for          filing/maintaining
the information collected for future reference as          needed.</p> 
     <p>The above record keeping requirements shall not apply to</p> 
     <ul>
<li>Minor modifications to Content previously contributed to and 
          accepted by the Committer(s).</li>
<li>Articles and White Papers</li>
<li>Information or minor Content modifications provided through bug
           reports, mailing lists and news groups </li>
</ul>       <p>While the record keeping requirements do not apply
to the items listed          above, Committers must conduct reasonable
due diligence to satisfy          themselves that proposed Contributions
can be licensed under the terms          of the CPL and Apache License
2.0.</p>     </section>
