<title>How to participate in the DITA Open Toolkit</title><?Pub Caret -2?>
<shortdesc>Any individual or any organization can contribute to the
project; contributions must adhere to the existing toolkit license(s)
and should fit in with the general goals of the project. All major
contributors will get appropriate recognition in release announcements
and on the project home page.</shortdesc>
<body>
<p>Contributors can submit new features, patches, and bug fixes using
existing github facilities (this is done by creating a "pull request"
within github). The Committer(s) who owns the relevant components
will first do due diligence to check code originality and licensing
according to the <xref href="ContributionPolicy.xml"></xref>. After
due diligence, the Committer(s) will use his/her own judgment on whether
to accept the code into the original code base, request updates to
the code, or suggest that the code be maintained as an external patch
or plug-in.</p>
<p>Contributions are always encouraged, and generally fall into one
of two groups, as determined by project Committers:<ul>
<li>Bug fixes and minor patches are accepted with little overhead.</li>
<li>Major contributions require the contributor to sign a form stating
that the submitter is free to commit the code (individually or on
behalf of an employer), and that the code complies with the current
toolkit license terms.</li>
</ul></p>
