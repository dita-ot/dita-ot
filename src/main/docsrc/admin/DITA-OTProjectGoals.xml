<p>The DITA-OT is designed to meet the needs of users who want to publish DITA content, from
individual users running the toolkit in a stand-alone mode to vendors who incorporate the toolkit
into their software products. The different distribution packages are designed to meet the needs of
these different audiences.</p>
<p>The DITA-OT project keeps up to date with the latest DTD and Schema updates from the OASIS DITA
Technical Committee (TC), which develops and maintains the DITA standard. As the DITA TC produces
drafts of future versions, the DITA-OT works to create early support for new features and helps to
test the new draft versions of the standard.</p>
<p>The project agrees with the open-source motto of <q>Release early and often</q> and seeks to
develop wide consensus on issues.</p>
