<section>       <title>DUE DILIGENCE AND RECORD KEEPING</title>  
    <p>The Committer(s), shall be responsible for scrutinizing all
Content          contributed to the DITA Open Toolkit project and
help ensure that the          Contribution Policy licensing requirements
set forth above are met.          Except as set forth below, the applicable
Committer shall conduct the          following activities prior to
uploading any Content into the repository          or otherwise making
the Content available for distribution: </p>       <ol>
<li>Contact the potential contributor of the Content through an  
         appropriate channel of communication and collect/confirm
the            following:           <ul>
<li>Contributor&apos;s name, current address, phone            number
and e-mail address;</li>
<li>Name and contact information of            the contributor&apos;s
current employer, if any;</li>
<li>If the            contributor is not self-employed, the Committer
must request and            receive a signed <xref
href="ContributionForm.xml">consent form</xref> (to be provided by
the Committer) from            the contributor&apos;s employer confirming
that the employer does not            object to the employee contributing
the Content. </li>
<li>Determine if the Content can be contributed under the terms of the Apache License 2.0 or the alternative terms and conditions supplied by the Contributor. This can be done by asking the
              contributor questions such as; <ol>
                <li>Did you develop all of the Content from scratch;</li>
                <li>If not, what materials did you use to develop the Content?</li>
                <li>Did you reference any confidential information of any third party? </li>
                <li>If you referenced third party materials, under what terms did you receive such materials? </li>
              </ol></li>
<li>If it is determined by            the Committer that the Content
is not the original work of the            Contributor, collect the
contact information of the copyright holder            of the original
or underlying work. The copyright holder of the            Content
or the underlying work may then need to be contacted to          
 collect additional information.</li>
</ul>         </li>
<li>The <draft-comment>was            &quot;Committer(s)&quot;</draft-comment>Contributor(s)
shall document            all information requested in (1) above and
fill in Contribution            Questionnaire (to be provided by the
Committer) and provide the            completed Contribution Questionnaire
to the Committer.</li>
<li>The Committer shall also be responsible for running a scan tool
to            help ensure that the Content does not include any code
not identified            by the contributor.</li>
<li> Based on the information collected, the Committer shall use 
          his/her reasonable judgment to determine if the Content
can be            contributed under terms and conditions that are
consistent with the            licensing requirements of this IP Policy. </li>
</ol>       <p>If the applicable Committer has any doubts about the ability to distribute the Content under terms and conditions that are consistent with the Apache License 2.0 or the proposed alternative
        terms and conditions, the Committer may not upload the code to the repository or otherwise distribute the Content. The Committer(s) shall be responsible for filing/maintaining the information
        collected for future reference as needed.</p> 
     <p>The above record keeping requirements shall not apply to</p> 
     <ul>

          accepted by the Committer(s).</li>
<li>Articles and White Papers</li>
<li>Information or minor Content modifications provided through bug
           reports, mailing lists and news groups </li>

        licensed under the terms of the Apache License 2.0.</p>     </section>
