 <title>Common HTML-based processing</title>
 <shortdesc>After the pre-processing operation runs, HTML-based builds each run a common series of Ant targets to generate HTML file. Navigation may be created before or after this set of common
    routines.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>After the pre-processing is completed, the following targets are run for all of the HTML-based builds:<ul>
        <li>If the <parmname>arg.css</parmname> parameter is passed to the build to add a CSS file, the <codeph>copy-css</codeph> target copies the CSS file from its source location to the relative
          location in the output directory.</li>
        <li>If a DITAVAL file is used, the <codeph>copy-revflag</codeph> target copies the default start- and end-revision flags into the output directory.</li>
        <li>The DITA topics are converted to HTML files. Unless the @chunk attribute was specified, each DITA topic in the temporary directory now corresponds to one HTML file.
            The<codeph>dita.inner.topics.xhtml</codeph> target is used to process documents that are in the map directory (or subdirectories of the map directory). The
            <codeph>dita.outer.topics.xhtml</codeph> target is used to process documents that are outside of the scope of the map, and thus might end up outside of the designated output directory.
          Various DITA-OT parameters control how documents processed by the <codeph>dita.outer.topics.xhtml</codeph> target are handled.</li>
      </ul></p>
