<title>Resolve map references (mapref)</title>
<shortdesc>The <codeph>mapref</codeph> step resolves references from one DITA map to another. This
        step is implemented in XSLT.</shortdesc>
<conbody>
<section><p>Maps reference other maps by using the following sorts of
    markup:<codeblock>&lt;topicref href="other.ditamap" format="ditamap"/>
...
&lt;mapref href="other.ditamap"/></codeblock></p><p>As a result of the mapref step, the element that references another map is replaced by the topic
    references from the other map. Relationship tables are pulled into the referencing map as a
    child of the root element (&lt;map> or a specialization of &lt;map>).</p></section>
