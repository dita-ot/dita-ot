<title>Map based linking (maplink and move-links)</title>
<shortdesc>These two steps work together to create links based on a map and move those links into
    the referenced topics. The links are created based on hierarchy in the DITA map, the
    @collection-type attribute, and relationship tables. This step is implemented in XSLT and
    Java.</shortdesc>
<conbody>
<section><p>The <codeph>maplink</codeph> module runs an XSLT program that evaluates the map; it places all
    the generated links into a single file in the temporary directory. The
     <codeph>move-links</codeph> module then runs a Java program that pushes the generated links
    into the applicable topics.</p></section>
