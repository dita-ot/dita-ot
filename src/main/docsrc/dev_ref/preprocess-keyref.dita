<title>Resolve keyref (keyref)</title>
<shortdesc>The <codeph>keyref</codeph> step examines all the keys that are defined in the DITA
  source and resolved the key references. Links that make use of keys are updated so that any @href
  value is replaced by the appropriate target; key-based text replacement is also performed. This
  step is implemented in Java.</shortdesc>
