<title>Move metadata (move-meta-entries)</title>
<shortdesc>The <codeph>move-meta-entries</codeph> step pushes metadata back and forth between maps
  and topics. For example, index entries and copyrights in the map are pushed into affected topics,
  so that the topics can be processed later in isolation while retaining all relevant metadata. This
  step is implemented in Java.</shortdesc>
