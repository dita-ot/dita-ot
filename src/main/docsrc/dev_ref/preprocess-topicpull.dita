<title>Pull content into topics (topicpull)</title>
<shortdesc>The <codeph>topicpull</codeph> step pulls content into &lt;xref> and &lt;link> elements.
This step is implemented in XSLT.</shortdesc>
<conbody>
<section><p>If an &lt;xref> element does not contain link text, the target is examined and the link text is
pulled. For example, a reference to a topic pulls the title of the topic; a reference to a list item
pulls the number of the item. If the &lt;xref> element references a topic that has a short
description, and the &lt;xref> element does not already contain a child &lt;desc> element, a
&lt;desc> element is created that contains the text from the topic short description.</p><p>The process is similar for &lt;link> elements. If the &lt;link> element does not have a child
&lt;linktext> element, one is created with the appropriate link text. Similarly, if the &lt;link>
element does not have a child &lt;desc> element, and the short description of the target can be
determined, a &lt;desc> element is created that contains the text from the topic short
description.</p></section>
