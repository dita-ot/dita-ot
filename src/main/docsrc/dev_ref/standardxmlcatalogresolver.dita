<title>Standard XML catalog resolver</title>
<conbody>
  <!--
<p rev="r3">In the previous releases of DITA Open Toolkit, a simple XML catalog
resolver is enabled. You do not need to update the reference to dtd in DITA
files when the file paths are changed; however, this simple implementation
cannot be redistributed because it does not support standard XML catalogs. </p>
-->
<p rev="r3">DITA Open Toolkit uses Apache XML Commons Resolver so that the references to DTD or XML
      Schema files in DITA files do not need to be updated each time when you change the file paths
      on your workstation or use another workstation. </p>
<p>With this feature, when a developer makes a new specialization, the developer only needs to
      update the mapping between the new DTD file's system id (location relative to the catalog
      file) and public id (the id assigned by the developer in the head of the DITA or xml file
      which identifies the corresponding dtd file) in the catalog file
        (<filepath>catalog-dita_template.xml</filepath>), for example, <codeph>&lt;public
        publicId="-//IBM//DTD DITA ABC//EN" uri="dtd/abc.dtd"&gt;&lt;/public&gt;</codeph>.</p>
