  <title>Testing some tweaks</title>
  <refbody>
    <section>
      <p>This section makes use of several tweak-controllable features. It 
        contains a draft comment, a required cleanup container, a figure whose 
        title can be shifted over or under the figure upon output, and a 
        section title that can be augmented with a graphical information 
        navigation icon or <i>ing</i> (see <i>do-place-ing</i> under 
        <i>behavior</i>).</p>
      <note type="note">This document will appear differently depending on 
        which stylesheet you use. If you view or process the document with a 
        standard shell (<i>dita2xhtml.xsl</i> or <i>dita2fo_shell.xsl</i>), the 
        special features will not be turned on. But if you process it into HTML 
        (or view it directly in Internet Explorer 6.0) using the 
        <i>myoverrides.xsl</i> demo stylesheet, the special features will be 
        enabled, resulting in different output styles. </note>
      <note type="tip">If you code your note type as <i>tip</i> and turn on the 
        <i>do-place-ing</i> behavior, as with this note, the output should 
        include a graphical icon alongside the text label.</note>
      <draft-comment>The following footnote is unrelated to the current 
        discussion. However, we are exploring both draft-comment and 
        required-cleanup markup here. Draft comments allow authors to share 
        comments between levels of a draft. Required cleanup sequesters 
        potentially faulty contents from output.</draft-comment>
      <fn callout="^">This is a footnote with a special callout character.</fn>
      <fig frame="all">
        <title>This is a <i>wild</i> title</title>
        <desc>A good <i>figure</i> doesn&apos;t need a thousand words unless it 
          is a technical description, in which case you probably can&apos;t say 
          enough.</desc>
