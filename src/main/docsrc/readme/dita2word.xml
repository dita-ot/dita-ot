<title>DITA to Rich Text Format </title>

    <navtitle>DITA to RTF</navtitle>
  </titlealts>
<shortdesc>The <option>wordrtf</option> transformation produces an RTF file for use by Microsoft
    Word.</shortdesc>
<conbody>
<p>The structure of the generated RTF file is the same as the navigation structure in the DITA map.
      To avoid losing files in the final output, make sure the DITA map contains all topics that are
      referenced from any individual topics.</p>
    <p>The <option>wordrtf</option> transformation has the following limitations:
      <ul>
        <li>Flagging, filtering, and revision bars are not supported.</li>
        <li>Style attributes for tables are not supported.</li>
        <li>Tables within list items are not supported.</li>
        <li>Output styles supported by other DITA-OT transformations, for example, X and Y, are not
          supported.</li>
      </ul><draft-comment author="Kristen James Eberlein" time="11 August 2012">What can we replace
        X and Y with? The original text read "There may be no output style applied on contents of
        some tags in Word RTF output compared with other output." Also, what does "Style attributes
        for tables are not supported" mean? </draft-comment>
