     <dlentry>
      <dt>Informational (I)</dt>
      <dd>The toolkit encountered a condition of which you should be aware. For example, draft
       comments are enabled and will be rendered in the output.</dd>

          <dlentry>
            <dt>Warning (W)</dt>
            <dd>The toolkit encountered a problem that should be corrected. Processing will continue,
              but the output might not be as expected.</dd>

     <dlentry>
      <dt>Error (E)</dt>
      <dd>The toolkit encountered a more severe problem, and the output is affected. For example,
