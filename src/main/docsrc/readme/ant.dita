 <conbody>
  <p>The DITA-OT uses Ant to manage the XSLT scripts that are used to perform the various
   transformation; it also uses Ant to manage intermediate steps that are written in Java. </p>
  <p>The most important Ant script is the <filepath>build.xml</filepath> file. This script defines
   and combines common pre-processing and output transformation routines; it also defines the
   DITA-OT extension points.</p>
