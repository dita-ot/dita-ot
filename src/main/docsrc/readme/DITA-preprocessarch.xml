<title>DITA pre-processing architecture</title>
<shortdesc>This document describes the different steps in preprocessing
for      DITA topics.</shortdesc>
<conbody>
<note>This topic was lasted updated for an earlier release of the
toolkit, and no longer includes all steps in the pre-process pipeline;
we expect to correct the documentation in the DITA-OT 1.5.2 release.</note><?Pub

<p>The DITA Open Toolkit implements a two-pass, map-driven architecture
that        resolves any conditional properties and content references
on the first        pass, then applies transformations to the normalized
files on the second        pass. The stages of this pre-processing
pipeline are described below.</p>
<section>       <title>genlist: generate list files of map and topic</title> 
     <p>Pass the files and generate list files that may be needed
by other          activity.<i>(Implemented by ANT extension with Java.)</i></p> 
   </section>
<section>       <title>filtering:</title>       <p>Filter the source
files according to the input          <filepath>.ditaval</filepath> file.
Based on the specified action,          either flag or exclude the
content according to the %select-atts.          <i>(Implemented by
ANT extension with Java.)</i></p>     </section>
<section>       <title>insert debug information (merged into filtering):</title> 
     <p>Add @xtrf and @xtrc attribute with proper values into each
         element.<i>(Implemented by ANT extension with Java.)</i></p> 
     <p>         <i>The output of this step is directed to a temp
directory.</i>       </p>     </section>
<section>       <title>adjust column names of table (merged into conref
resolve          activity):</title>       <p>Adjust all of the column
names of the tables to &quot;col1, col2, col3          ...&quot; to
enable conref between tables.<i>(Implemented by ANT          extension

adjusted in the content that was conrefed            during the process

index entries contained in the &lt;topicmeta&gt; tag into the

ANT          extension with Java.)</i></p>     </section>
