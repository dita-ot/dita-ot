 <title>Overview of the DITA Open Toolkit</title>
 <shortdesc>The DITA Open Toolkit (DITA-OT) is an open-source implementation of the OASIS DITA
  specification, which is developed by the OASIS DITA Technical Committee. The DITA-OT is a set of
  Java-based, open-source tools and Ant scripts that transform DITA content (maps and topics) into
  deliverable formats, including Eclipse Help, HTML Help, JavaHelp, PDF, and XHTML.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>While the DITA standard is owned and developed by OASIS, the DITA-OT project is governed separately; the DITA-OT is an independent, open-source implementation of the DITA standard. The DITA-OT is
      available without charge and is licensed under the Apache 2.0 open-source licenses.</p>
