<h1 class="topictitle1">Evaluating the DITA Open Toolkit (Full Easy Install)</h1>


<div><p>The most common scenario for first users of the DITA Open
Toolkit is to evaluate how it functions. Previous versions of the
Toolkit required a number of preliminary installation steps for components
necessary both to run the base function and to show off additional
output capabilities. With DITA-OT 1.4.2, three versions of the Toolkit
are now available: the minimal package (updates core function only),
standard package (minimal plus docs and demos), and a "full easy
install package" that basically installs everything you need
to enable quick and easy evaluation of the Toolkit. This topic deals
with installing and using the full easy install package for the first
time.</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> This topic explains how to use the Full Easy Install on Windows;
the three versions are also available on all other supported platforms.
For a description of all packages available, see <a href="http://dita.xml.org/wiki/dita-ot-packages" target="_blank">What
packages are available for the DITA Open Toolkit</a> at dita.xml.org.</div>

<p>Unzip or extract the "full_easy_install" zip file to
a convenient directory, such as your c: drive's root directory.
The package will create a directory such as C:\DITA-OT-1.5.1\ that
contains not only the usual Toolkit materials but also all the run-time
components needed to run the Toolkit in a basic evaluation mode.</p>

<p>Browse over to this new directory and double-click on the "startcmd.bat"
file in that directory. A new "command shell" window will
open up, with the environment variables already set to enable the
Toolkit to run within that shell.</p>

<p>At the command prompt (usually c:\DITA-OT1.5.1\ for this version),
type "ant samples.web -f build_demo.xml". After a series
of processing messages, there should be a new \out directory in the
DITA-OT1.5.1\ directory that contains a folder with the resulting
HTML output in it. Congratulations on creating your first example
of DITA output!</p>

<p>Now try the full set of transforms from a single command: "ant
all -f build_demo.xml". This command will process every DITA
example in the Toolkit into each of the supported output types for
the Toolkit. After a much longer flurry of messages, the \out directory
should have a number of folders in it, each with several deliverables
produced by the Toolkit demos. If you happen to have the Microsoft
HTMLHelp Workshop or the JavaHelp toolset installed for other work
you have done with User Assistance, you might even get ready-to use
CHM and JavaHelp output files. By comparing the outputs with the various
source materials in the distribution, you can get an idea about how
the processing works. That explanation is best found in the DITA Open
Toolkit User Guide and at the <a href="http://dita.xml.org/wiki/the-dita-open-toolkit" target="_blank">DITA-OT
Focus Area</a> at http://dita.xml.org .</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Demo targets</h2><p>Here are the individual demo
targets that you can try while evaluating the DITA Open Toolkit. Note
that most are subcomponents of larger operations--you can use any
of these individually.</p>

<p>If
you do not specify a target for <span class="filepath">build_demo.xml</span>,
the default target is <samp class="codeph">prompt</samp>. </p>
<p>You can also
try your hand at modifying some of the sample scripts in the ant directory.
These represent the kind of driver files that you would create for
your own projects. You can easily adapt these to process your own
test DITA files, for example. Call the other ant samples after this
example: </p>
<pre class="pre">c:\DITA-OT1.5.1&gt;ant -f samples/ant_sample/sample_xhtml.xml</pre>
<p>(This
is basically the same as running <samp class="codeph">ant samples.web -f build_demo.xml</samp>,
but intended for you to modify.) </p>
<p>You will find the output for
this exercise in the <span class="filepath">samples/ant_sample/</span> directory
itself. You can add parameters to the <span class="filepath">sample_xhtml.xml</span> file
to change where your outputs end up, and also to modify the build
process in other ways. See the documentation for Ant parameters to
learn more about processing options.</p>
