# DITA-OT Support 

DITA-OT is maintained by a [small group of volunteers][1]  who work on the project in their spare time. 

With these limited resources, we can't offer direct support, but the DITA community offers several other forums, including:

* The [DITA-OT project website][2] at [dita-ot.org][2] provides information about the latest toolkit releases, including [download links][3], release notes, and [documentation][4] for recent DITA-OT versions.
* The [Yahoo! dita-users group][5] is the original DITA list-serv and a vital resource for the DITA community. People post regularly, both asking for and offering help. While the archived messages can be difficult to search, this is a treasure trove of information.
* The [DITA-OT Users Google Group][6] is a general interest DITA-OT product forum, for questions on any aspect of the toolkit â€” from installation and getting started to questions about specific overrides, plug-ins, and customizations.
* The StackOverflow developer community includes [topics related to DITA-OT][7].
